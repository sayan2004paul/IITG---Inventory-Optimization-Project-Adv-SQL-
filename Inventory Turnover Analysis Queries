1)  What is the inventory turnover ratio per SKU and store over the last 3/6 months?
  Purpose: Identify fast vs. slow-moving products using the classic formula



A) For last 3 months 


SELECT 
    Store_ID,
    Product_ID,
    SUM(Units_Sold) AS total_units_sold,
    ROUND(AVG(Inventory_Level), 2) AS avg_inventory_level,
    ROUND(SUM(Units_Sold) / NULLIF(AVG(Inventory_Level), 0), 2) AS inventory_turnover_ratio
FROM 
    final_fact
WHERE 
    Date BETWEEN '2023-10-01' AND '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY 
    Store_ID, Product_ID
ORDER BY 
    Store_ID,inventory_turnover_ratio DESC;



B) For last 6 months 


SELECT 
    Store_ID,
    Product_ID,
    SUM(Units_Sold) AS total_units_sold,
    ROUND(AVG(Inventory_Level), 2) AS avg_inventory_level,
    ROUND(SUM(Units_Sold) / NULLIF(AVG(Inventory_Level), 0), 2) AS inventory_turnover_ratio
FROM 
    final_fact
WHERE 
    Date BETWEEN '2023-07-01' AND '2024-01-01'
