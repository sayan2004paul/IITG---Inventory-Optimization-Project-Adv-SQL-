Question 1:
Write a solution to find the average monthly units sold for each product across all seasons. Identify the top 5 products with the highest average monthly sales.


A) Top 5 products across all seasons 

SELECT 
    f.Product_ID,
    s.Seasonality,
    SUM(f.Units_Sold) / 3.0 AS avg_monthly_units_sold
FROM final_fact f
JOIN dim_seasons s ON f.season_id = s.season_id
GROUP BY f.Product_ID, s.Seasonality
ORDER BY avg_monthly_units_sold DESC
LIMIT 5;




B) Top 5 products of every season

WITH CTE AS (SELECT 
    f.Product_ID,
    s.Seasonality,
    SUM(f.Units_Sold) / 3.0 AS avg_monthly_units_sold
FROM final_fact f
JOIN dim_seasons s ON f.season_id = s.season_id
GROUP BY f.Product_ID, s.Seasonality
ORDER BY Seasonality ,Product_ID,avg_monthly_units_sold DESC),

CTE1 AS (SELECT 
 Product_ID, Seasonality , avg_monthly_units_sold,
 DENSE_RANK()OVER(PARTITION BY Seasonality ORDER BY  avg_monthly_units_sold DESC) AS rnk
  FROM CTE)
  SELECT 
    Product_ID, Seasonality , avg_monthly_units_sold
     FROM CTE1 
      WHERE rnk<=5








Question 2:
Write a solution to rank product categories by their total seasonal demand. For each season, rank the categories by total units sold. If two categories tie, assign them the same rank. Use dense ranking.



WITH CTE AS (SELECT 
 s.Seasonality, c.Category, SUM(f.Units_Sold) AS total_units 
FROM 
 final_fact f 
  JOIN 
   dim_cat c ON f.cat_id=c.cat_id
    JOIN 
     dim_seasons s 
      ON f.season_id=s.season_id
       GROUP BY 
          s.Seasonality, c.Category)
          
          SELECT 
             Seasonality, Category, total_units,
              DENSE_RANK()
               OVER(PARTITION BY  Seasonality ORDER BY  total_units DESC) AS rnk
                FROM CTE
