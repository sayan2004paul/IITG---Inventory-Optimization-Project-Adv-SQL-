# Overall Demand Forecasting Insights & Recommendations:


The data reveals distinct **seasonal demand patterns**, with Furniture peaking in Spring/Winter (520K and 508K units), Toys dominating Summer (502K units), and Groceries leading Autumn (518K units), indicating clear category rotation tied to external factors like holidays and climate. High-performing **anchor SKUs (P0014, P0016, P0006, P0010, P0019)** demonstrate stable demand (~45K units/month) across seasons, making them ideal for inventory prioritization and promotional bundling. Conversely, products with **volatile seasonal spikes** (e.g., P0015 in Winter) require targeted campaigns to avoid overstock. The **mismatch between inventory and sales** for top overstocked products (e.g., P0018 Clothing, P0014 Toys) highlights inefficiencies in procurement planning, where excess stock exceeds 50% of inventory. These insights underscore the need for **season-aware forecasting**, dynamic pricing for volatile items, and lean inventory strategies to align stock levels with cyclical demand, reducing carrying costs while maximizing revenue opportunities.








## 2. Key Insights & Interpretation

### 2.1 Seasonal Demand Patterns

#### Observation:

\- Autumn: Groceries dominate (518K units), likely due to festive/harvest demand.

\- Spring & Winter: Furniture leads (520K & 508K units), indicating home upgrades in cooler months.

\- Summer: Toys peak (502K units), aligning with school breaks.

#### What This Represents:

\- Demand is cyclical, not uniform. Categories rotate based on external factors (climate, holidays).

\- Opportunity: Align procurement and promotions with seasonal peaks to avoid overstock/stockouts.

### 2.2 Top-Performing Products (Strategic SKUs)

#### Observation:

\- P0014, P0016, P0006, P0010, P0019 consistently rank in top 5 across seasons.

\- These SKUs show stable demand (~45K units/month) regardless of seasonality.

#### What This Represents:

\- Anchor products that drive consistent revenue. Ideal for:

\- Core inventory (prioritize stock replenishment).

\- Bundling (pair with seasonal items to boost sales).



### 2.3 Volatility in Seasonal Demand

#### Observation:

\- Some products (e.g., P0015 in Winter) spike in specific seasons but drop in others.

\- High standard deviation in sales for certain SKUs.

#### What This Represents:

\- Opportunity Zones: Use these for limited-time offers or seasonal exclusives.

\- Risk: Avoid year-round overstocking; plan markdowns post-season.

# Recommendations 

## 1. Seasonal Procurement Alignment

Action: Adjust procurement plans to align with seasonal category demand peaks (e.g., increase grocery stock before Autumn, furniture before Spring/Winter).

Impact: Minimizes stockouts during high-demand periods and reduces excess inventory costs.

## 2. Anchor SKU Prioritization

Action: Designate stable, high-demand products (e.g., P0014, P0016, P0006) as core SKUs.

Impact: Ensures uninterrupted availability, supports bundling strategies, and sustains baseline revenue.

## 3. Targeted Promotions for Volatile SKUs

Action: Launch time-bound campaigns for season-specific spikes (e.g., P0015 in Winter).

Impact: Captures short-term demand while preventing post-season overstock.

## 4. Overstock Optimization

Action: Identify overstock-prone SKUs (e.g., P0018, P0014) and tighten reorder thresholds based on historical sell-through rates.

Impact: Reduces inventory holding costs and improves warehouse efficiency.

## 5. Implement Season-Aware Forecasting
 
Action: Integrate seasonal trend data into demand forecasting models.

Impact: Enhances accuracy in supply planning, enabling proactive response to cyclical shifts.

## 6. Dynamic Pricing Strategy

Action: Introduce seasonal pricing for volatile items to boost pre-peak sales and enable timely markdowns.

Impact: Maximizes revenue during peak, reduces end-of-season surplus.
