# Overall Demand Forecasting Insights & Recommendations:


The data reveals distinct **seasonal demand patterns**, with Furniture peaking in Spring/Winter (520K and 508K units), Toys dominating Summer (502K units), and Groceries leading Autumn (518K units), indicating clear category rotation tied to external factors like holidays and climate. High-performing **anchor SKUs (P0014, P0016, P0006, P0010, P0019)** demonstrate stable demand (~45K units/month) across seasons, making them ideal for inventory prioritization and promotional bundling. Conversely, products with **volatile seasonal spikes** (e.g., P0015 in Winter) require targeted campaigns to avoid overstock. The **mismatch between inventory and sales** for top overstocked products (e.g., P0018 Clothing, P0014 Toys) highlights inefficiencies in procurement planning, where excess stock exceeds 50% of inventory. These insights underscore the need for **season-aware forecasting**, dynamic pricing for volatile items, and lean inventory strategies to align stock levels with cyclical demand, reducing carrying costs while maximizing revenue opportunities.
