Question 1:
Write a solution to identify the top 5 products that are most overstocked. For each product, calculate the overstock as (Inventory Level â€“ Units Sold). Rank the products in descending order of overstock quantity.


WITH filtered_data AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM final_fact f
     JOIN 
      dim_cat c  USING(cat_id)
    WHERE Date >= DATE_SUB('2024-01-01', INTERVAL 6 MONTH)
),

product_overstock AS (
    SELECT 
        Product_ID,
        Category,
        SUM(Inventory_Level) AS total_inventory,
        SUM(Units_Sold) AS total_units_sold,
        (SUM(Inventory_Level) - SUM(Units_Sold)) AS overstock_amount
    FROM filtered_data
    GROUP BY Product_ID, Category
),

ranked_overstock AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY overstock_amount DESC) AS overstock_rank
    FROM product_overstock
)

SELECT 
    Product_ID,
    Category,
    total_inventory,
    total_units_sold,
    overstock_amount,
    overstock_rank
FROM ranked_overstock
WHERE overstock_rank <= 5
ORDER BY overstock_rank;
