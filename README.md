## Inventory Level Monitoring Queries :- 

### BASIC QUERIES :

1. Current Stock Overview

•	Purpose: Identify which categories dominate inventory and regional distribution patterns.

3. Fast vs. Slow-Moving Products
"Which products have the highest and lowest sales-to-inventory ratios (indicating fast/slow movers)?"
•	Purpose: Spot potential overstocks (low ratio) and stockout risks (high ratio).

5. Basic Stockout Detection
"Which products currently have inventory levels below 10 units (immediate restock candidates)?"
•	Purpose: Flag urgent replenishment needs.

7. Regional Stock Comparisons
"How does average inventory level compare between North, South, East, and West warehouses?"
•	Purpose: Reveal imbalances in regional stocking strategies.

9. Inventory Age Tracking
"Which products have been in inventory for the longest time without being sold?"
•	Purpose: Highlight stagnant inventory for clearance decisions.
