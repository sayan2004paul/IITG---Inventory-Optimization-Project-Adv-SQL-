### 1\. **Inventory Concentration & Distribution**

**Insight:**

*   _Furniture_ holds the highest inventory, _electronics_ the lowest.
    
*   _Clothing_ dominates inventory across all regions.

    

Reveals: This may indicate over-allocation of stock to furniture and underinvestment in electronics, or a misalignment between stocking strategy and actual sales velocity.

**Recommendations:**

*   Conduct **category-level sales-to-inventory ratio analysis** weekly to continuously align stocking levels with demand.
    
*   Evaluate **space utilization and carrying cost** of bulky furniture in high-inventory regions.
    
*   Reassess **reorder thresholds** for electronics if understocking affects availability.





    

### 2. **Fast and Slow Movers (SKU & Category Level)**

**Insight:**

*   Top fast movers: P0005, P0015
    
*   Slowest movers: P0008, P0019, P0002
    
*   Clothing and furniture are fast-moving overall; groceries, toys, and electronics are slower.
    

Reveals: You may be **overstocking slow-moving categories** and **risking stockouts** in high-velocity SKUs if not properly monitored.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Phase out or discount** slow-moving SKUs like P0002, P0008, or bundle them for clearance.
    
*   Use **ABC or XYZ analysis** to prioritize inventory:
    
    *   ‘A’ for fast-movers → frequent reordering, minimal safety stock
        
    *   ‘C’ for slow-movers → infrequent reordering, consider discontinuation
        
*   Introduce **dynamic pricing/promotions** for slow movers to drive demand.







    

### 3 . **Current Stockout Risk Assessment**

**Insight:**

*   No product is currently below forecast demand.
    
*   However, 13 SKUs show **early signs of risk** (low diff between inventory and forecast).
    

Reveals: Your inventory is healthy overall, but **certain SKUs are approaching danger zones**, needing proactive review.

**Recommendations:**

*   Monitor these SKUs (P0001, P0003, P0005, etc.) weekly with **automated alerts**.
    
*   Set **SKU-specific safety stock thresholds** using standard deviation (already calculated).
    
*   Add **color-coded stockout risk flags** in dashboard views for quick ops response.
    











### 4 . **Regional Stock Level Comparison**

**Insight:**

*   South and East have highest average inventory; West is lowest.
    
*   Store-level discrepancies exist (e.g., S005 highest in East & South, S002 lowest in North & East).
    

Reveals: There is a potential **regional overstock-understock imbalance** that might lead to service inconsistencies or fulfillment delays.

**Recommendations:**

*   Use **location-wise replenishment algorithms** (e.g., Min-Max or EOQ by region).
    
*   Implement a **regional demand forecasting model** to guide stocking per zone.
    
*   Consider **regional promotions or clearance** in high-stock stores like S005 (East/South).










    

### 5 . **Inventory Age Analysis**

**Insight:**

*   No products unsold long-term or for over 30 days.
    

Reveals: Your current **stock rotation and replenishment cycle is healthy** — a strong signal for operational effectiveness.

**Recommendations:**

*   Maintain existing **inventory review cadence**, but keep periodic checks (e.g., monthly unsold report).
    
*   Set up **automated dead stock alerts** as a preventive control, even if no issues currently exist.
















    

### 6 . **Cross-Region Transfer Need**

**Insight:**

*   No inter-warehouse transfers required; stock levels are stable across locations.
    

Reveals: Stock distribution is currently **balanced and efficient**; warehousing strategy is working.

**Recommendations:**

*   Continue monitoring SKU-wise regional inventory quarterly.
    
*   Build an **inter-warehouse transfer module** into the system as a fallback when thresholds are breached.













    

### 7. **Forecast Gaps at Store Level (2024)**

**Insight:**

*   Stores S001, S003, S004, S005 had inventory below forecast during 2024.
    

Reveals: Some locations may have **forecasting or delivery lag issues**, risking customer experience or missed sales.

**Recommendations:**

*   Strengthen **store-level forecasting** using historical patterns, local demand behavior.
    
*   Consider implementing **demand sensing models** for dynamic forecast adjustments.
    
*   Introduce **auto-replenishment** triggers when forecast consistently exceeds current stock.
